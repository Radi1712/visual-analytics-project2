# Visual Analytics Project 2

**This is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/fakhar23/visual-analytics-project2) containing the implementation for the second of two group projects for the course "Visuelle Datenanalyse" during my Master's studies.**
The task was to create a clean dataset about board games from BoardGameGeek for the year 2021 from two different sources \[[1](https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/bgg-ranking-historicals), [2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mshepherd/board-games)\] and subsequently design and implement interesting visualizations from this data.
The visualizations were created using a mixture of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and contain different parameters that the user can interact with.
To get the necessary packages, first install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run the following commands:
Run this command to go through the initialization process:

```bash
npm init
```

To install the packages run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the webserver containing the visualizations run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Lastly, to reach the webserver, go to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser of choice.
